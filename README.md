## Next.js Booking.com clone - Ethical Web Scraping





This project implements a functional Booking.com clone using Next.js. It leverages web scraping techniques to retrieve accommodation data while adhering to ethical scraping practices (avoid overwhelming Booking.com's servers and respecting their terms). Users can search for hotels based on location, dates, and number of guests, with results displayed within the application.

## Key Features:

User-friendly search interface
Search results incorporating hotel details

## Ethical Considerations:

Web scraping is implemented responsibly, respecting Booking.com's robots.txt and terms of service.
Caching mechanisms can be employed to minimize scraping frequency.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
